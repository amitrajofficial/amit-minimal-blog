Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack developer working primarily with ReactJS and NodeJS. Apart from my job, I have been into marketing since 2013. 
I have handled digital marketing for Bollywood movies, well-known brands, best-selling authors, politicians, photographers, and makeup artists.

In my free time, you can find me learning, discussing and exploring ideas and startups.
