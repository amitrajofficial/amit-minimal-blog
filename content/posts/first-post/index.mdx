>I was working on a use-case where I had to pick some data using sftp on the server and process those data to save in the local-db then upload and store the received data in a s3 bucket to serve as a backup, all to be done asynchronously.

If youâ€™re looking to for to compress files/folders into .zip , I would recommend using [archiver npm-package.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/archiver)

Sample code:
```js
var file_system = require('fs');
var archiver = require('archiver');

var output = file_system.createWriteStream('target.zip');
var archive = archiver('zip');

output.on('close', function () {
    console.log(archive.pointer() + ' total bytes');
    console.log('archiver has been finalized and the output file descriptor has closed.');
});

archive.on('error', function(err){
    throw err;
});

archive.pipe(output);

// append files from a sub-directory, putting its contents at the root of archive
archive.directory(source_dir, false);

// append files from a sub-directory and naming it `new-subdir` within the archive
archive.directory('subdir/', 'new-subdir');

archive.finalize();
```

Upload to s3 right after archiving the data:

Sample Code:
```js
const fs = require('fs');
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');

const s3 = new AWS.S3({
    accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
});

const fileName = 'target.zip';

const uploadFile = () => {
  fs.readFile(fileName, (err, data) => {
     if (err) throw err;
     const params = {
         Bucket: 'testBucket', // pass your bucket name
         Key: 'target.zip', // file will be saved as testBucket/target.zip
         Body: JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)
     };
     s3.upload(params, function(s3Err, data) {
         if (s3Err) throw s3Err
         console.log(`File uploaded successfully at ${data.Location}`)
     });
  });
};

uploadFile();
```

Once all file were compressed and uploaded to s3, I was deleting all the files from the server so that it is not processed again.

Sample Code for Deleting Files:
```js
async deleteFiles(filepath) {
  try {
    filepath.forEach(path => {
      if (path.indexOf('.') === -1) {
        fs.existsSync(path) && fs.rmdirSync(path, { recursive: true });
      } else {
        fs.existsSync(path) && fs.unlinkSync(path)
      }
      this.logger.info(`DELETED ${path}`);
    })
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err)
  }
}
```
